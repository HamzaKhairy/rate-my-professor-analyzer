# Leveraging Large Language Models in Software Engineering to Summarize Professor Ratings

## Introduction
This project aims to simplify the professor selection process for students by using an automated system to collect, summarize, and analyze professor ratings from platforms like Rate My Professor. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, our tool will provide students with nuanced summaries and categorized feedback to make informed decisions on professor and course selection.

## Motivation
Selecting courses and professors is challenging due to the volume and subjectivity of available ratings scattered across platforms. By automating the analysis and classification of comments, this project will offer students a more accessible and insightful approach to evaluate professor ratings.

## Problem Statement
Current professor rating platforms require users to manually sift through numerous comments to gain insights on a professor's teaching style and course structure. This project addresses the need for an automated approach to categorize and summarize feedback, helping students make faster, well-informed decisions.

## Proposed Work
- **Data Collection:** Develop a script to automatically collect user comments from Rate My Professor.
- **NLP Summarization:** Implement an NLP model to identify key insights within collected comments.
- **Comment Classification:** Build a classifier to label comments as negative, neutral, or positive.
- **Recommendation Algorithm:** Create a recommendation system that suggests professors based on aggregated feedback and student preferences.

## Evaluation Plan
- **Effectiveness Metrics:** Measure classification accuracy and relevance of summarized feedback.
- **User Testing:** Conduct surveys to evaluate the usefulness and reliability of recommendations.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare automated recommendations with manual reviews to assess improvements in time efficiency and insight quality.
